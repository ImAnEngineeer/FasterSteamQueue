# FasterSteamQueue
A simple script that makes you save time while browsing the steam queue.

Following changes fix some issues to that are really annoying when browsing through tons of trash:
 
- add to wishlisht/follow/ignore buttons move you to the next item in queue
- bottom right section that shows if the game is coop/multiplayer moved to top right so you don't have to scroll
- when a queue ends, next one is immediately started

Feel free to propose improvements.
